# HighQualityYoutube
This userscript forces Youtube to always play videos at their highest available quality.

### As A Userscript
Recently, I noticed that Youtube was playing all of my videos at 480p when higher definition streams were available. This is why I created this userscript that executes a series of clicks in order to change the quality of the video without user interaction. This script can be added through a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey. In order to do so, look up how to install a userscript from a raw url for your extension of choice; then use this link: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nicholas264/HighQualityYoutube/master/userscript.js`

### As A Chrome Extension
In order to use this as a Chrome extension, download the `.zip` file from the current version's release, and extract it to your directory of choice. Next, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, and click `Load unpacked`. From there you can select the directory where you extracted the files. If you ever move them to a different location, you will need to load the unpacked extension again from the new directory.
